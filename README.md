# Pehchaan.io: Start Conversations with Strangers with Basic Information About them Using Scraping and LLMs

Welcome to the Pehchaan.io GitHub repository! Pehchaan.io is an application that allows you to start conversations with strangers by gathering basic information about them from online sources such as Twitter and LinkedIn. By leveraging web scraping techniques and Language Models (LLMs), Pehchaan.io generates icebreakers and provides valuable insights to help you initiate meaningful conversations.

## Project Overview
The goal of Pehchaan.io is to provide a tool that retrieves public information about an individual based on their name. The application searches for the person's Twitter and LinkedIn accounts and extracts relevant details from these platforms. Using this information, Pehchaan.io generates engaging icebreakers and conversation starters, enabling users to establish connections with others more easily.
Throughout the development of this application, we gained valuable insights into the core components of Lang Chain. We delved into chains, agents, custom agents, tools, custom tools, output parsers, and more. The knowledge acquired during this project has helped us expand our understanding of Lang Chain's capabilities.

## Project Phases
The project consists of the following phases:

### Input and Data Retrieval:: 
In this phase, the application receives a name as input and searches online for the person's Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. The relevant information is extracted from these sources.

### Icebreaker Generation: 
Using the gathered information, Pehchaan.io generates interesting and personalized icebreakers. These icebreakers serve as conversation starters and provide valuable insights about the individual.

### User Interface: 
The third phase involves developing a user-friendly interface for Pehchaan.io. The interface allows users to input a name, view the generated icebreakers, and initiate conversations with strangers effortlessly.

### Scraping and LLM Integration: 
This final phase focuses on integrating web scraping techniques and Language Models into the application. These technologies enable Pehchaan.io to gather information from online sources and generate conversational prompts effectively.
